## Installing and loading `gamar`

Installing `devtools` if needed:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Installing `gamar`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("choisy/gamar")
```

Loading `gamar`:

```{r}
library(gamar)
```

Defining the path to GAMA executable, if needed (if you are using Mac OS,
`gamar` will by default use the `/Applications/Gama.app` if it exists):

```{r eval = FALSE}
defpath("path_to_your_GAMA_folder")
```

## Handling experiments

There are a number of built-in examples in the `gamar` package, of which you
can see the list:

```{r}
examples()
```

To use one of these examples, we recommand that you first move it to your local
directory (by default):

```{r}
dir()
examples("sir")
dir()
```

or to any other directory of your choice:

```{r}
examples("sir", "one_directory")
dir()
dir("one_directory")
```

If a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory, the
name of the copied file is appended a digit making it unique:

```{r}
examples("sir", "one_directory")
dir("one_directory")
```

The minimum that these examples include is a `.gaml` file that specifies the
model and some experiment(s). Sometimes additional files are also included, for
examples, shape files defining the space. That's the case for the `predator-prey`
model. All the files of the model are then contained in a directory:

```{r}
dir()
examples("predator-prey")
dir("predator_prey", recursive = TRUE)
```

Again, if the name of the directory already exists in the destination directory,
the name of the directory is appended a digit making it unique:

```{r}
examples("predator-prey")
dir()
```

Last thing about this `examples` function is that you can copied several models
at the same time:

```{r}
examples(c("sir", "predator-prey"))
```

specifying a common destination directory:

```{r}
examples(c("sir", "predator-prey"), "common_directory")
dir()
dir("common_directory")
```

or a different directory for each model:

```{r}
examples(c("sir", "predator-prey"), c("directory1", "directory2"))
dir()
dir("directory1")
dir("directory2")
```

Once the file(s) of a model are copied to any of your local working directory
(on which you have writting rights), you can load an experiment from a `.gaml`
file. For example, loading experiment `sir` from the `sir.gaml` GAML file:

```{r}
dir()
ls()
sir <- experiment("sir", "sir.gaml") # creates workgamar with sir_1.xml in it
dir()
ls()
```

Note that it creates object `sir` (which is the name of the experiment) in the
workspace. This object is linked to the original `.gaml` file that contains the
experiment description (in terms of parameters values and outputs) as well as
the description of the model (in terms of world and species). Note finally that
it also creates a directory `workgamar` that contains an XML version of the
experiment. The loaded object is of class `experiment`:

```{r}
class(sir)
```

or

```{r}
is.experiment(sir)
```

You can see that this object contains the experiment description in terms of 
parameters values and outputs as well as the link to the original `.gaml` file
that contains in addition the description of the model in terms of world and
species:

```{r}
sir
```

There are a number of accessor and assignator methods associated to this
`experiment` class. You can retrive the names of the experiment parameters
(input and output):

```{r}
names(sir)
```

And the name of the `.gaml` file to which your `experiment` object is linked:

```{r}
fname(sir)
```

And you can also change the `.gaml` file to which the `experiment` object is
linked, either specifying a relative path:

```{r}
fname(sir) <- "sir_1.gaml"
fname(sir)
```

or an absolute path:

```{r}
fname(sir) <- paste0(getwd(), "/sir.gaml")
fname(sir)
```

The most general accessor/assignator is through the `[` operator that can take
a single argument:

```{r}
sir["S0"]
sir["I"]
sir["sourcePath"]
```

or multiple arguments at the same time:

```{r}
sir[c("I0", "R", "finalStep")]
```

To change the value of one parameter, it's as simple as

```{r}
sir["R0"]
sir["R0"] <- 10
sir["R0"]
```

Same thing with several parameters at the same time:

```{r}
sir[c("beta", "gamma")]
sir[c("beta", "gamma")] <- 3 * sir[c("beta", "gamma")]
sir[c("beta", "gamma")]
```

Note the equivalences between the `[` accessor/assignator operator and the
`name` and `fname` shortcut functions:

```{r}
fname(sir)
```

is equivalent to

```{r}
sir["sourcePath"]
```

The only difference being that the shortcut functions return unnamed vectors.

### Model

To finish with experiments handling, with can also edit the `.gaml` model file:

```{r eval=F}
model(sir)
```

This allows to edit the `.gaml` file to which the experiment is linked.

### Plans of experiments

Let's see now how we can gather together several experiments of a same model
into an experiment plan and let's introduce the `plan` class:

```{r}
plan1 <- c(sir, sir)
class(plan1)
is.plan(plan1)
```

You can see a summary of the content of the experimental plan:

```{r}
plan1
```

Note that it renames experiments so that they have non-conflicting names. Note
also that all the characteristic of the experiments of a plan is that they are
all linked to the same `.gaml` file (i.e. the same underlying model structure).
An alternative way to define the structure of a plan is with the `rep` function:

```{r}
plan2 <- rep(sir, 3)
plan2
```

A third way to define a plan of experiments is from an experiment and a data
frame of values. As an example, let's consider the following fake data frame:

```{r include = FALSE}
n <- 7
thenames <- names(sir)
thenames <- thenames[!(thenames %in% c("experiment", "sourcePath"))]
fakedf <- setNames(
  10 * as.data.frame(matrix(round(runif(n*length(thenames)), 4), n)),
  thenames)
fakedf$id <- 1:7
```

```{r}
fakedf
```

A plan of experiments can be generated from this data frame, simply by
associating it to the `sir` experiment:

```{r}
(sir_plan <- plan(fakedf, sir))
```

Note that the names of the experiments come from the row names of the data
frames:

```{r}
names(sir_plan)
names(sir_plan["1"])
# which is equivalent to:
names(sir_plan[1])
```

If we had more explicit row names in the data frame we'd get this:

```{r}
rownames(fakedf) <- paste0("sir", seq_len(nrow(fakedf)))
(sir_plan <- plan(fakedf, sir))
```

Note also that you can combine objects of class `experiment` and `plan` in the
concatenator function `c`:

```{r}
plan3 <- c(sir, plan1, plan2)
plan3
```

There are a number of useful methods defined with this `plan` class to retrieve
the number of experiments in the experimental plan:

```{r}
length(plan3)
```

or to see or change the names of the experiments in the plan:

```{r}
names(plan3)
names(plan3) <- paste0("sir", seq_along(plan3))
plan3
```

## Simulating experiments 

```{r eval = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
out1 <- run(sir, 1, "output1")
str(out1)
```

```{r eval = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
out2 <- run(plan1, 1, "output2")
str(out2)
```

## Session information

```{r eval = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
